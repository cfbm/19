## Description

Sports gamers have been clamoring for college football to return to the video game scene since 2013. With Madden 19 releasing on PC, this was made possible. This mod provides players with 32 of the top teams in college football today. Each teams' roster is filled with 75 accurately-named, rated, and equipped athletes. Each team has their correct field and stunningly-accurate uniforms. Beyond the teams, we have added an accurate college ball, referee uniforms, and college-specific game rules. All of this together provides you with a complete play-now college football experience in Madden 19 on PC. 
 
This mod does not add Dynasty Mode or anything similar. This was not intended to be used in franchise mode. What you do in CFM is up to you, but do not rely on the mod providing an accurate experience in the mode, as it is not editable at this time.
